# Relase v2.6.0

## Additions

- add a C#-like `??` null-coalescing syntax to support selective updates
    ```PHP
    $builder->updates([
        ['??field', null] // this field is ommitted when building query
    ]);
    ```
- improve the logging of `BusinessProcess`

## Bugfixes

- fixed a bug in `Builder` that made a test fail only on `nightly` build of php
