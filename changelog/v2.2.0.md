# Changelog for v2.2.0
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrisandchris/symfony-rowmapper.svg?branch=target%2F2.2.0)](https://travis-ci.org/chrisandchris/symfony-rowmapper)

This file is the changelog for changes from version 2.1.0 to 2.2.0

Comparing v2.1.0 to v2.2.0, this version does not break backward compatibility completely, as most of the interfaces and public methods remained the same. Most of the breaking changes are internal, so they won't affect most of the users. The following changes to public method signatures have been made:

- The `MySQLMapper` class does not depend anymore on `Model`, but on `ConcreteModel`
- The `DefaultParser` now requires the `event_dispatcher` service instead a specific `SnippetBag`

I dropped support for PHP 5.6.

## Changes
* collecting snippet bags is now event driven, making it easier to expand them
* database mapper are also now event driver, making it easier to expand them too
* a lot of stuff is now database system independent (or interchangeable)
* the `ConcreteModel` now does not anymore supports transaction, this would be the responsibility of the business process

## Â Additions
* added support for pgsql (pgsql snippet bag, pgsql database mapper)
 
## Fixes
* fixed an issue that caused automatic mapping to fail anyway (threw excepetion even if mapping was run)

## Removals

## Deprecations
* the `Model::setMustHaveResult()` method is deprecated and to be removed in v2.3.0
